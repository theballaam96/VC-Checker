# VC Checker

VC Checker is a python script which detects for potential code in your .c source files (for N64 game building) which might crash on the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console.

## Usage

```shell
python vc-checker.py {directory/file}
```
This will spit out a series of information which may need to be investigated if you are experiencing crashes with a certain element of your ROM Hack
